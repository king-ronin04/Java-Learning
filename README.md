# Java-Learning

JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.

**Simple Hello World Java Program:**
```
// A Java Program to print "Hello World!"
public class Main{
    public static void main(String [] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

**Output:** <br>
```
Hello World
```


**The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:**

- Abstraction<br>
- Encapsulation<br>
- Inheritance<br>
- Polymorphism
